This is a project that describes the bike sales data for Toman Bikeshares Company
The project involves 2 csv files, bike_share_yr_0.csv and bike_share_yr_1.csv containing sales data for each year.
I imported the csv files to mysql for cleaning and extraction of relevant tables.
Toman bike sale query.sql is an SQL file that shows the queries i used to extract the useful columns from the csv files into derived tables.
The derived table is imported to PowerBI for insightful visualization as seen in Toman Bikesales.pbix.
